When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Use remote repository to collaborate with friends on the internet.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Manually pull changes make me aware of what happened at the remote.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork operates in GitHub to replicate from other people's account to my own remote repository.
	Clone operates from Github to my local repository.
	Brank operates in my local repository to generate separate paths.
