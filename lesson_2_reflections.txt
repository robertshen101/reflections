What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    .git directory is created to hold metadata/hidtory of the files in the
    repository.  This is necessary to make the repository functional.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Working Directory is where the daily work is done, experiment is conducted, invention is implemented.
    Staging area is where you prepare to harvest and store the fruits you grow.
    	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Use git add to move the target file to the staging area, then
	use git commit to update the repository with this single logical change.
